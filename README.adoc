====== Project website: http://www.mycontroller.org
====== Want to try now? http://demo.mycontroller.org[Go to demo server]

== About

*MyController.org* is automation controller for home, office or any place.
Primarly this project started to support http://www.mysensors.org/[MySensors]. But later it expands support to other network also. Considered system resources in mind on development, as a outcome even we can run it on Raspberry PI (256 MB) very first model.

== Localization
====== For localization Contribute to the Transifex Project
===== https://www.transifex.com/mycontrollerorg/gui-angularjs/[Web GUI Project]

== System Requirement

MyController.org is a very lightweight server, It required very less resource, believe me ;)

  * Disk        : ~30 MB (can require more if you store metrics data for long time)
  * Memory(RAM) : 40 MB
  * Java        : 1.8 or later

  NOTE: Test done up to 5 nodes and 30 sensors with the above configuration.

===== Supported Platforms (tested)
MyController.org is java based application server. We can run it in any platform where Java support is available.

- Linux
- Windows
- Raspberry PI (Oracle Java recommend)

* https://github.com/mycontroller-org/mycontroller/releases/download/0.0.3-alpha1/mycontroller-standalone-0.0.3-alpha1-bundle.tar.gz[mycontroller-standalone-0.0.3-alpha1-bundle.tar.gz]

====== Configuration

Extract downloaded bundle where exactly do you want to run. Configuration files located in `mycontroller/conf`

File: `mycontroller.properties`

*Temporary file*
```
mcc.tmp.location=tmp/
```
You can change default location and file name. This file used as server temporery location. Used for the operation such as backup, restore, etc.,

*Database Configuration*
```
mcc.h2db.location=../conf/mycontroller
```
You can change default location and file name. File will be stored with the file extension `.h2.db`. Do not add file extenstion.

*Web server configuration*
```
enable.https=true
http.port=8443
ssl.keystore.file=../conf/keystore.jks
ssl.keystore.password=password
ssl.keystore.type=JKS
```
- `enable.https` : Enable/disable https. Only one protocol supported at a time.
- `http.port` : Port number you want to access MyController.org server
- `ssl.keystore.file, ssl.keystore.password, ssl.keystore.type` : If https is enabled these fields are mandatory.

Default URL: `https://<ip>:8443` (ex: `https://localhost:8443`)

Default username/password: `admin/admin`

IMPORTANT: Change default `ssl.keystore.file` and `ssl.keystore.password` and https protocol is recommended
